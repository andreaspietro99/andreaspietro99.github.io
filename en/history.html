                <h2>1930-1960</h2>
                <p>
                    It all began when Luigi, Andreas' great-grandfather, also known as 'paneturot' (little baker in Piedmontese), left his job as a baker to devote himself to cultivating his beloved land around the house, which his wife took care of in Serravalle Langhe.
                    At the time the land was mainly planted with wheat, maize, fodder for animals and a few rows of vines from which the family used to make some wine. In those days, hazelnut cultivation was restricted to small plots of land that were
                    particularly steep and rugged and where nothing else could be grown.

                <p>
                    Around the 1960s, Luigi and his son Giovanni decided to replace the small vineyard on the land behind the house with a hazelnut grove. At that time, the hazelnut harvest was still entirely manual and therefore hard and laborious, but it was also an unforgettable
                    family moment, as many relatives were called together to help out, making it a time for celebration and laughter. Teresa, while everyone was working in the fields, gave her best in the kitchen preparing fantastic dishes and, in particular,
                    a ragout whose fragrance spread throughout the house and remains an everlasting memory for those who lived those years.

                <p>
                    These habits did not change for years until 1994: the flood that hit the area did not spare our fields, taking away the work of a whole life. It was on this occasion that Giovanni, called Gianni and grandfather of Andreas, took charge of the situation,
                    and decided to believe in this land by buying more and planting new hazelnut trees. The villagers watched in astonishment incessant effort of Gianni who, undaunted, completed the work thanks to the precious help of his wife Carla.

                    Gianni and Carla have won their bet: they have succeeded in enhancing the value of their land despite everything and everyone. But their successes do not end there: they have been able to pass on the principles that guided Luigi and Teresa to their daughter
                    Loredana and also to their grandson Andreas. That same grandson, who has been helping them since he was a child, is now in his early twenties and has decided to invest in this land, driven by the same values: respect for nature and
                    love for the land.
                    <br> &laquo;Although I have not had the opportunity to know in depth my great grandfather Luigi, I can recognize him every day watching over our work from its two centuries-old plants, that today are the symbol of the very essence
                    of this activity: values so strong to overcome a century of history.&raquo;
